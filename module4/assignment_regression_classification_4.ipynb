    "- [ ] Watch Aaron's [video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pREaWFli-5I) (12 minutes) & [video #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQgVt4hFgY) (9 minutes) to learn about the mathematics of Logistic Regression.\n",
    "- [ ] [Sign up for a Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/), if you donâ€™t already have one. Go to our Kaggle InClass competition website. You will be given the URL in Slack. Go to the Rules page. Accept the rules of the competition.\n",
    "- [ ] Do train/validate/test split with the Tanzania Waterpumps data.\n",
    "- [ ] Begin with baselines for classification.\n",
    "- [ ] Use scikit-learn for logistic regression.\n",
    "- [ ] Get your validation accuracy score.\n",
    "- [ ] Submit your predictions to our Kaggle competition. (Go to our Kaggle InClass competition webpage. Use the blue **Submit Predictions** button to upload your CSV file. Or you can use the Kaggle API to submit your predictions.)\n",

    "- [ ] Add your own stretch goal(s) !\n",
    "- [ ] Clean the data. For ideas, refer to [The Quartz guide to bad data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide),  a \"reference to problems seen in real-world data along with suggestions on how to resolve them.\" One of the issues is [\"Zeros replace missing values.\"](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide#zeros-replace-missing-values)\n",
    "- [ ] Make exploratory visualizations.\n",
    "- [ ] Do one-hot encoding. For example, you could try `quantity`, `basin`, `extraction_type_class`, and more. (But remember it may not work with high cardinality categoricals.)\n",
    "- [ ] Do [feature scaling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).\n",
    "- [ ] Get and plot your coefficients.\n",
